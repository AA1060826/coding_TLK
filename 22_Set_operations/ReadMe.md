1.Create set1 with elements {1, 2, 3, 4}
2.Create set2 with elements {3, 4, 5, 6}

3.Perform union of set1 and set2 → store in variable
4.perform intersection of set1 and set2 → store in variable
5.Perform difference of set1 minus set2 → store in variable

6.Print "Union:", union_set
7.Print "Intersection:", intersection_set
8.Print "Difference:", difference_set
