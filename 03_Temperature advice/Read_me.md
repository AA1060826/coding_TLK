1. Ask the user to enter the current temperature (in Celsius).
2. Store the temperature in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to give advice based on the temperature.
4. if Temp <= 10 then print "Its a cold day!!! wear a jacket and warm up"
5. if Temp <= 25 and Temp >10 then print "Its a nice warm day, wear short sleeves"
6. if Temp >25 and Temp <100 then print "Its a hot day, stay cool"
