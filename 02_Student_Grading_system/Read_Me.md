Create a python program that asks for a student's score and then provides a grade based on score.

1. Ask the user for their score out of 100
2. store the score in a variable
3. use conditionals to assign numbers into grades.
4. if scr >= 90 and scr <= 100: print("grade A")
5. if scr >= 80 and scr <= 89: print("grade B")
6. if scr >= 70 and scr <= 79: print("grade C")
7. if scr >= 60 and scr <=69:  print("grade D")
8. if scr < 60: print("grade F")
9. else print("Wrong input")
